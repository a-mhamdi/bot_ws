We begin by checking which shell we are using on `Linux`:
```bash
which $SHELL
```
Sourcing our **ROS** installation.
```bash
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
```
Run the `turtlesim_node` executable from the `turtlesim` package.
```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node
```
The below command returns the list of current active topics
```bash
ros2 topic list -t
```
Details on a particular type of message can be retrieved through: 
```bash
ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
```
We can publish data on a topic as follows:
```bash
ros2 topic pub --once /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 1.}}"
```
`--once` means we publish only one message and exit.
```bash
ros2 topic pub -r 1 /turtle1/cmd_vel geometry_msgs/msg/Twist "{linear: {x: 1.,y: 0.,z:0.}, angular:{x: 0.,y: 0.,z: .7}}"
```
`-r 1` means we keep publishing our message in a steady stream at 1 Hz.
We can see the data being published on the `/turtle1/cmd_vel` by running:
```bash
ros2 topic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel
```
We can also use the keyboard to move around `turtle1`
```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard --ros-args --remap cmd_vel:=/turtle1/cmd_vel
```
The executable `turtlesim_teleop` do the same previous thing and allows to avoid all the hastle of remapping
```bash
ros2 run turtlesim turtle_teleop_key
```
This utility allows us to display the graph of data flow between our running nodes; 
```bash
rqt_graph
```
